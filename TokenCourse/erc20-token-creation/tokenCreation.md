A token standard tells us what functionality the contract needs to be compliant with it. How this functionality is implemented is up to the developers. In this contract, we are going to use an ERC20 token contract implementation from OpenZeppelin (line 4). 

Have a look at their nicely documented <a href="https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol" target="_blank">ERC20 contract</a> to have a better understanding of how an implementation could look like. Apart from the functionality specified in the ERC20 standard, the contract provides additional functionality.

We create our own contract called MyToken (line 6), which inherits (line 6) the functionality from the OpenZepplin ERC20 token contract implementation that we imported (line 4).

This contract implements the optional functions `name()` and `symbol()` of the ERC20 Token standard and has a constructor where their values can be set during the deployment of the contract (line 7).
In this case, we are going to use the default values, we call our token the same as the contract `"MyToken"` and make `"MTK"` its symbol.

Next, we make use of the inherited `_mint` function (line 8) that allows us to create tokens upon deployment of the contract. Inside the parameters, we specify the address of the account that gets the tokens and the amount of tokens that are created. 
In this case, the account that deploys the contract will receive the tokens and we set the amount to 1000000 to the power of `decimals()`. The optional function `decimals()` of the ERC20 token standard is implemented and set to the default value of 18. We will create 1000000 tokens that will have 18 decimals.
