In this section, we will learn how a contract can send and receive Ether.

### Sending Ether
We have three different options to transfer Ether: `transfer()`, `send()` and `call()`.

#### **transfer**
`<address payable>.transfer(uint256 amount)`
* `transfer()` throws an exception on failure 
* Forwards a fixed 2300 gas stipend
* Member of `address payable`

An example of `transfer()` can be seen in the `SendEther` contract (line 35).
`Transfer()` is not recommended to be used anymore.

#### **send**
`<address payable>.send(uint256 amount) returns (bool)`
* `send()` returns false on failure 
* Forwards a fixed 2300 gas stipend
* Member of address payable

An example of `send()` can be seen in the `SendEther` contract (line 41).
`Send()` is not recommended to be used anymore.

#### **call**
`<address>.call(bytes memory) returns (bool, bytes memory)`
* `call()` returns false on failure 
* Forwards the maximum of gas, but this is adjustable
* Member of address

An example of `call()` can be seen in the `SendEther` contract (line 48).
`Call()` is currently recommended to transfer Ether.

The reason `transfer()` and `send()` were introduced was to guard against *reentry attacks* by limiting the forwarded gas to 2300, which would be insufficient to make a reentrant call that can modify storage.

As we discussed in the last section, each operation on Ethereum has a specific cost associated with it. These costs are now subject to change, and smart contracts should avoid relying on specific gas costs.

That’s why `call()` instead of `transfer()` is now recommended to send Ether.

### Reentrancy attack
A *reentrancy attack* occurs when a function makes an external call to an untrusted contract and, the attacker uses the contract to make recursive calls back to the original function before it finishes its execution. In this way, the attacker can drain funds and manipulate data in unintended ways.

To guard against the *reentrancy attack* we should do all state changes before calling an external contract. This is also called the [Checks-Effects-Interactions](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/security-considerations.html#re-entrancy) pattern.

Another way to prevent reentrancy is to use a *Reentrancy Guard* that checks for such calls and rejects them. You can see an example of this in the contract of our modifier section or a more gas-efficient version on [open zeppelin](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/security/ReentrancyGuard.sol).

### Receiving Ether
If we want to enable a contract to receive Ether without a function being called, we need to create a `receive` function (line 22) or `fallback` function (line 25); otherwise, the Ether will be rejected, and throw an exception.

The `receive` function is executed on calls with empty calldata (e.g. plain Ether transfers via send() or transfer()), the fallback function on calls with calldata. If no receive function exists but a fallback function, calls with empty calldata will also use the fallback function.

### Payable function modifier
The `payable` function modifier allows a function to receive Ether.

The `receive` function (line 22) needs to be `payable`. If you delete the `payable` modifier you will get an error from the compiler. If you delete the `payable` modifier from the `fallback` function (line 25) it will compile, but it won’t be able to receive Ether.
The functions `sendViaTransfer`, `sendViaSend`, and `sendViaCall` (lines 33, 38, and 45) also need to be `payable` in order to receive Ether.

### Payable address
Solidity makes a distinction between two different flavors of the address data type.

`address`: Holds a 20-byte value.
`address payable`: Holds a 20-byte value and can receive Ether via its members transfer and send.

If you change the parameter type for the functions `sendViaTransfer` and `sendViaSend` (line 33 and 38) from `payable address` to `address` you won’t be able to use `transfer()` (line 35) or `send()` (line 41).
