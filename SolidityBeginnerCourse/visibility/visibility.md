The `visibility` specifier is used to control who has access to functions and state variables.

There are four types of visibilities: `external`, `public`, `internal`, and `private`. 

They regulate if functions and state variables can be called from inside the contract, from contracts that derive from the contract (child contracts), or other contracts and transactions.

### private
- Can be called from inside the contract
- Can not be called from a child contract
- Can not be called from other contracts or transactions

### internal
- Can be called from inside the contract
- Can be called from a child contract
- Can not be called from other contracts or transactions

### public
- Can be called from inside the contract
- Can be called from a child contract
- Can be be called from other contracts or transactions

### external
- Can not be called from inside the contract
- Can not be called from a child contract
- Can be be called from other contracts or transactions
- State variables can not be `external`

In this example, we have two contracts, the `Base` contract (Line 4) and the `Child` contract (Line 55) which inherits the functions and state variables from the `Base` contract.

When you uncomment the `testPrivateFunc` (Line 58) you get an error because the child contract doesnâ€™t have access to the private function `privateFunc` from the `Base` contract.

If you compile and deploy the two contracts you will not be able to call the functions `privateFunc` and `internalFunc` directly only via `testPrivateFunc` and `testInternalFunc`.
